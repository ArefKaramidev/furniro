          Embodying the raw, wayward spirit of rock ‘n’ roll, the Kilburn

          Weighing in under 7 pounds, the Kilburn is a lightweight piece of
          vintage styled engineering. Setting the bar as one of the loudest
          <br />
          speakers in its class, the Kilburn is a compact, stout-hearted hero
          with a well-balanced audio which boasts a clear midrange and
          <br />
          extended highs for a sound that is both articulate and pronounced. The
          analogue knobs allow you to fine tune the controls to your
          <br />
          personal preferences while the guitar-influenced leather strap enables
          easy and stylish travel.
